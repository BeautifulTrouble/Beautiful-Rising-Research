Beautiful Rising: Reuse & remixing
==================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

To date, Beautiful Trouble has experimented with a [JSON API](http://beautifultrouble.org/api/) to it's structured content (Tactics, Principles, Theories, Practitioners, and Case Studies). The API has been used to create an [experimental data visualization & monadic exploration tool](http://explore.beautifultrouble.org/#-1:00000).

We see this idea -- an API to the underlying content -- as a core concept (rather than an add-on) of the Beautiful Rising project, and an opportunity to be able to rapidly prototype new products or ideas while working directly with activists in the Global South.

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs in this category are:

* Provide a RESTful JSON interface to the project's core content types
* Endpoints to access translations
* Options to filter responses (tag, type, etc.)

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* Audio recording endpoints
* Submission endpoints

## Solutions to explore

### Crisis.net 
_CrisisNET finds, formats and exposes crisis data in a simple, intuitive structure that’s accessible anywhere. Now developers, journalists and analysts can skip the days of tedious data processing and get to work in minutes with only a few lines of code._

* Great example of a public-data API

### Swagger™
Swagger™ is a specification and complete framework implementation for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services.

* Nice option for generating developer-friendly API documentation
