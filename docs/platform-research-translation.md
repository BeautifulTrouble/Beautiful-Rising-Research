Beautiful Rising: Multilingual content/Tranlations
==================================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

To date, Beautiful Trouble has published a "full edition" in English, and a "pocket edition" in English. The Beautiful Trouble editorial collective and our publisher have worked with activists groups and regional publishers publish editions in Spanish, Portugese, and more. 

We have not yet, however, endeavoured to make those translations avaialble on the Beautiful Trouble web site. The Beautiful Rising project requires that the core content be avaialbe in several languages.

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs are:

* Provide translators with the finalized "core" content and a means to submit back translations

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* A way to accept translations through a variety of channels
* A way to accept translations from a variety of individuals, not just our core translation team
* A way to track changes to translated content, and see a history of the translation

## Solutions to explore
