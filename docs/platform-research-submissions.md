Beautiful Rising: User-submitted material
=========================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

To date, Beautiful Trouble has been using very manual methods of soliciting and accepting submissions. Mostly, these are solicited in person or by e-mail. Then an editor works with the contributor in Google Docs.

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs in this category are:

* To encourage and facilitate the submission of new modules, module translations, and input from a global community of activists.

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* Easy-to-submit content: this would be broadly sought, and would take the form of comments, questions, and ideas for new modules.
* Examples of tactics in action: the ability for users to flag news stories that chronicle "examples" of Beautiful Rising principles and tactics being used in the real world.
* Core content: From our experience working on Beautiful Trouble, it is our proposal that core content would be sought selectively, mostly via in-person trainings, through Action Aidâ€™s network of trainers and partners, and through global activist organizations with the capacity to work through an editorial process to make their content consistent and useful.
