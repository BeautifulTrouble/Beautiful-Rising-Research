Beautiful Rising: Publishing & Distributing Beautiful Rising 
============================================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

To date, Beautiful Trouble has been [published online using Wordpress](https://github.com/BeautifulTrouble/beautifultrouble-dot-org), and [with print and electronic editions](http://beautifultrouble.org/the-book/) by [OR Books](http://orbooks.com).

Starting with [Beautiful Solutions](http://beautifulsolutions.info), [we've begun to explore](https://github.com/BeautifulTrouble/solutions.thischangeseverything.org) a "[CMS-free](http://www.developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/)" publishing approach using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). The project is still "in progress."

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs in this category are:

* To provide access to the complete set of Beautiful Rising "modules" (content) in a variety of mediums, including:
* Offline-friendly reading experience
* A printer-friendy version, for offline distribution
* Interactive/explorable web experience

... And in alternate languages, including:
* Arabic
* Burmese
* Swahili

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* Distribute automatically to as many channels as possible (eBook, PDF, audio, etc.)
* Accept corrections and additions directly from the module being viewed/read
* Solicit translations directions from the content being viewed
