Beautiful Rising: Access in countries that implement filtering / censorship
===========================================================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

To date, Beautiful Trouble has not had to contend directly with Internet filtering or censorship, nor direct attempts to overwhelm our hosting resources.

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs are:

* For the resource to be available/accessible in environments where the Internet is filtered or censored
* To not put the privacy of the end-user at risk when they access or use the resource
* For the resource to be easily mirrored / hosted with DDOS mitigation services

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* For the resource to run completely offline, but to securely/privately request updates when started
* Provide end-users with the means to securely communicate back to the project, sending questions, updates, translations, etc.

All of these would need to be evaluated in more detail, after assessing the level of filtering and risk in the target countries.

## Solutions to explore

### Leap EIP
_The LEAP platform includes an Encrypted Internet Proxy (EIP) service that is hassle-free, automatically self-configuring, and provides an enhanced level of security. Initially, this EIP service will be built using OpenVPN, but we may include the option of using Tor as an alternate transport in the future._
