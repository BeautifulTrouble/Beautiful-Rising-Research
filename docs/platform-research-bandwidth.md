Beautiful Rising: Bandwidth limitations / No Internet
=====================================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

We've done some very preliminary prototyping of "Single page JavaScript application" that works offline for the [Beautiful Solutions][bsol] project.

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs in this category are:

* Ensuring the resource is available to users in low / no Internet situations.

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* An “offline mode” for the resource that would allow it to be downloaded once (when Internet is available) and would then be available for use or distribution without an Internet connection.

There is some overlap here with the [publishing](docs/platform-research-publishing.md) research.
