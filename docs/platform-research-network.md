Beautiful Rising: Activist Network & Community
==============================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

To date, Beautiful Trouble has been developin a mostly North American and European activist network and community of contributors. We are looking to Beautiful Rising as an opportunity to expand this network to the Global South and to increase the diversity of the network & community.

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs in this category are:

* Let the "internal" Beautiful Rising teams (editorial, design, technical, etc.) safely communicate with in-country networks
* Let the external community securely and privately communicate back to Beautiful Rising

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* Enable the global Beautiful Rising community to securely & privately communicate with each other
