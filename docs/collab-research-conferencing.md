Beautiful Rising: Audio / video conferencing
============================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

To date, Beautiful Trouble has been using the [Calliflower](http://www.calliflower.com/) audio conferencing service, mostly for the global dial-in numbers (though, they donâ€™t reach the target countries for this project), as well as [Skype](http://skype.com) and, more recently, [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/hangouts/).

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs are:

* Audio conferencing for multiple participants
* Either local dial-in numbers, or accessible via the Internet (VOIP, WebRTC, etc.)

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* Call recording
* Video conferencing for multiple participants
* Slide or screen sharing

## Solution to be piloted

For the initial in-country session in Burma/Myanmar, we have decided to pilot the Jitsi audio/video conferencing solution(s). We believe that this combination will provide the in-country sessions with:

* An audio/video "window" into the event for remote participants
* A privacy-enhancing environment, where no web services or log-ins are required to access the conference

Additionally, it will enable session facilitators, and our team more broadly, to:

* Set-up permanent "rooms" for various working groups
* Work on a shared document (integrated Etherpad)
* Record session audio when necessary

We will explore hosting this solution on Beautiful Rising infastructure to help to ensure that access and session logs are in our control, and possibly to provide access to the service through a hidden Tor service.

If you have questions, comments, or suggestions on the above, [please let us know][team].
