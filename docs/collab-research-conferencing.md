Beautiful Rising: Audio / video conferencing
============================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

To date, Beautiful Trouble has been using the [Calliflower](http://www.calliflower.com/) audio conferencing service, mostly for the global dial-in numbers (though, they donâ€™t reach the target countries for this project), as well as [Skype](http://skype.com) and, more recently, [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/hangouts/).

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs are:

* Audio conferencing for multiple participants
* Either local dial-in numbers, or accessible via the Internet (VOIP, WebRTC, etc.)

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* Call recording
* Video conferencing for multiple participants
* Slide or screen sharing
