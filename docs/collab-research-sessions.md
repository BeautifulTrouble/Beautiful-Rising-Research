Beautiful Rising: In-country session support
============================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

To date, Beautiful Trouble has only delivered workshops and trainings in North America and Eastern Europe. Aside from the technical challenges that will possibly be present when working in the Global South, the Beautiful Rising sessions are less workshop and more of a "listening & curating" opportunity, combined with a [Book Sprint](http://www.booksprints.net/).

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs are:

* Session participants should be able to collaborate without Internet access, specifically:
* Share documents of any kind between participants, and with the session facilitators
* Collaboratively edit text-based documents
* Have country context knowledge of information laws, rights, and surveillance before facilitating.  A working document or resource bank that covers changes to laws and institutional capacities.

Anna Levy adds: I think for all of these, we have to consider options that are not 'open' given the degree of secrecy needed for activists and advocates to do their work effectively and without fear of reprisal.

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* Synchronous chat
* Provide translations
* Access to the public Internet via a VPN, [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), or both
* Access to the public Internet via a 3G signal if available
