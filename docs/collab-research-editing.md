Beautiful Rising: Collaborative document editing
================================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

To date, Beautiful Trouble has used Google Docs intensively and exclusively for colalborative document editing. For many reasons, we are currently exploring other options for Beautiful Rising.

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs in this category are:

* Enable many individuals to contribute to a single document
* Contributing should be easy
* Sharing the document with contributors should be easy
* Revision history / compare versions

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* Internal "comments" between the people working on the document
* Offline access
* Suggest changs (vs. editing directly)
* Anonymous edits / privacy options

Initial document loading will include:

* 4-5 templates (tactics, theories, principles, case studies)
* 10 modules transfered to Beautiful Rising editing format
* A long list (~50) of Beautiful Trouble modules that could be used in Beautiful Rising

Also, Anna Levy said:

> For advocates and activists in the Global South, it's important for these shared doc options (not necessarily for us) to have multi-platform contribution options. I.e., people can send in SMS and contribute to docs in progress. It doesn't need to be SMS specific, but assuming that service areas will be shaky, it would be interesting to have options for sharing into a doc without opening a computer or smartphone.

## Solution to be piloted

For the initial in-country session in Burma/Myanmar, we have decided to pilot a collaborative document-editing solution on top of plain-text [Markdown][markdown] files and [Github][github]. We believe that this combination will provide the in-country session participants with:

* Low-tech, offline-friendly ways to access templates and example documents
* A privacy-enhancing environment, where no web services or log-ins are *required* to contribute

Additionally, it will enable session facilitators to:

* Travel with the documents on a USB key
* Work on the documents offline / without access to the Internet

More broadly, we believe that "working in the open" on Github will benefit the project and the larger community. Documents hosted on Github are publicly avaialble without requiring registration (we will provide direction on how to access them anonymously) and can be easily shared and improved.

As we move from the in-country session work to the curation and co-editing work, we will endeavour to improve existing tools (like those listed below) to make the editing, reviewing, and submission experiences as non-technical and user-friendly as possible.

If you have questions, comments, or suggestions on the above, [please let us know][team].
