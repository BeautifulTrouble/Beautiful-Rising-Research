Beautiful Rising: Challenges to collaboration
=============================================

Some of the challenges that we’ve documented in deploying these collaboration tools in the Global South context are:

* **Hardware & software limitations**: it’s very likely that collaborators will not be using contemporary hardware or software and that some of the systems we’ve been using will simply not work.
* **Bandwidth limitations**: similarly, many of the tools we have been using require a relatively fast & stable Internet connection to work effectively. Options that can work in bandwidth-limited environments need to be researched & tested.
* **Security concerns**: the tools we use should be privacy respecting and enhancing, or -- failing that -- we should be able to provide clear guidance to collaborators on how to protect themselves while working with us.
