Beautiful Rising: Access from smart phones
==========================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

Beautiful Trouble has yet to deloy a smartphone-specific product, either HTML5 or native. For Beautiful Rising we'll need to determine if deploying a product like this would improve distribution of the resource, or provide access to it in ways that circumvent Internet filters, tracking, or censorhip.

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs in this category are:

* Ensuring the resource is available to users with smartphones

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* Making the resource available in online "app stores" and so on 

There is some overlap here with the [publishing](docs/platform-research-publishing.md) research.
