Beautiful Rising: Access from smart phones
==========================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

Beautiful Trouble has yet to deloy a smartphone-specific product, either HTML5 or native. For Beautiful Rising we'll need to determine if deploying a product like this would improve distribution of the resource, or provide access to it in ways that circumvent Internet filters, tracking, or censorhip.

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs in this category are:

* Making the resource available and fully functional to users without desktop or laptop computers, accessing it from a smartphone. 

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* Develop a “downloadable app” (but an open-source app, not one that is available exclusively through app stores) that is optimized for smartphones, which uses the phone’s local storage capacity to store the most up-to-date version of the resource, making it quick to use and available without a data connection.

There is some overlap here with the [publishing](docs/platform-research-publishing.md) research.

## Solutions to explore

### PhoneGap
_PhoneGap is a free and open source framework that allows you to create mobile apps using standardized web APIs for the platforms you care about._

> Easily create apps using the web technologies you know and love: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

* Open source :thumbsup:
