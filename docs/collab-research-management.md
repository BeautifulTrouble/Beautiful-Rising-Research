Beautiful Rising: Project management & internal communications
==============================================================

Reviewing the options below, can you speak to what solutions your own organization or the organizations that you work with in the Global South use to address these needs? Are there solutions that are particularly well-suited that we should be looking into? Are there solutions that we should avoid? And, if so, why?

To date, Beautiful Trouble has used [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) almost exclusively. In fact, the entier Beautiful Trouble ecosystem -- Beautiful Trouble Training, Beautiful Rising, Beautiful Solutions, Climate Ribbon, etc. -- have doubled-down on Basecamp for the time being, as a way to organize our various projects and calendars in one central system. For better or worse, that's where we are today.

## Requirements

The minimum requirements for the project's needs are:

* Communicate easily with the [advisory network members][advisorynetwork]
* Communicate with the project participants (in-country participants, external/extended, etc.)
* Share a public calendar of project activities
* Assign tasks to individuals, with due dates
* Share documentation with the public

The "would be nice" requirements are:

* Nested tasks (hierchical)
* Moving one date/task, moves related dates/tasks
* A Gantt chart type view of dates

## Solutions to explore

### Riseup mailing list
_Riseup provides online communication tools for people and groups working on liberatory social change. We are a project to create democratic alternatives and practice self-determination by controlling our own secure means of communications._
https://help.riseup.net/

* The right politics :thumbsup:
* We know them :thumbsup:
* Mailing lists are simple to use :thumbsup:

Who to talk to:
* Most of us, I would guess
* We've set-up the [advisory network][advisorynetwork] mailing list there for starters

### Pulse 
_Pulse (previously Syncthing) replaces proprietary sync and cloud services with something open, trustworthy and distributed. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, if it is shared with some third party, and how it's transmitted over the Internet._

https://ind.ie/pulse/

* Open source :thumbsup:
* Private. None of your data is ever stored anywhere other than on your devices. There is no central server that might be compromised, legally or illegally. :thumbsup:
* Encrypted. All communication is secured using TLS. The encryption used includes perfect forward secrecy to prevent any eavesdropper from ever gaining access to your data. :thumbsup:
* Authenticated. Every node is identified by a strong cryptographic certificate. Only nodes you have explicitly allowed can connect to your cluster. :thumbsup:

### ownCloud
_ownCloud provides access to your data through a web interface or WebDAV while providing a platform to easily view, sync and share across devices—all under your control. ownCloud’s open architecture is extensible via a simple but powerful API for applications and plugins and works with any storage._

* They are used by many for both open source software project, and documentation projects
* Even for [collaboratively writing a political manifesto](https://github.com/openpolitics/manifesto/issues)
