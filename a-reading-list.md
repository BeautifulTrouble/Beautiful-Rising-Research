=============================================

## Bandwidth, access, & filtering

* [OOKLA's Net Index Explorer](http://explorer.netindex.com/maps): Maps global download/upload speeds over time based on user-submitted data. Admittedly, not a super-accurate picture as it would likely be used by those with good access, e.g., <http://explorer.netindex.com/maps?country=Bangladesh>

* [OOKLA's Net Index](http://www.netindex.com/download/map): Again, question of who self-selects to use the speed test, but large data set and data on several of the countries that Beautiful Rising is looking at.

## Anonymity
